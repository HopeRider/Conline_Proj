# Conline

Conline is a video conferencing application similar to Zoom, with an additional AI-powered emotion detection system that analyzes participants' emotions in real-time during meetings.

## üöÄ Features

- Video meetings via **ZeGcloud**
- Real-time emotion detection with AI integration
- Secure authentication using **Firebase Auth**
- Emotion data stored in **Firebase Storage**


## üß† AI Emotion Detection

The emotion detection system uses a pre-trained machine learning model (`.h5`) served via **Flask**. Every 3 seconds, the user's camera frame is sent to the Flask server for prediction. The detected emotion is then sent back to the main application and displayed in real-time during the meeting.

## üõ† Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**
- **Elastic UI (EUI)**

### Backend:
- **Firebase Auth** - for user authentication
- **Firebase Storage** - for storing meeting data and emotion analysis
- **ZeGcloud** - for video meeting interface
- **Flask** - serving the AI model
- **TensorFlow / Keras** - for AI emotion detection model
